**Network Optimization Case Study: Small Business Latency Issue**

## **Client Overview**
- **Business Type:** Small Business (20 Employees)
- **Location:** Office-Based Setup
- **Issue:** Slow internet speeds, frequent disconnections, high latency affecting business operations.
- **Existing Network Setup:**
  - ISP Router with default settings
  - No VLAN segmentation
  - High device congestion on the 2.4GHz band
  - No Quality of Service (QoS) configuration
  - No firewall optimizations

## **Problem Statement**
A small business with **20 employees** experienced constant **slow internet speeds**, frequent network disconnections, and high latency when using cloud-based business applications. Employees working remotely also reported difficulties in connecting to the network securely.

## **Network Audit & Troubleshooting**

### **Step 1: Network Analysis**
- **Tools Used:** Wireshark, PingPlotter, Speedtest.net
- **Findings:**
  - **Packet loss of 10%** detected due to congestion.
  - **Network latency: 150ms** (above the acceptable range of <50ms).
  - **Interference detected on the 2.4GHz frequency band.**
  - **Unsecured guest devices consuming 40% of bandwidth.**
  - **No firewall rules in place to filter traffic.**

## **Solution Implementation**

### **Step 2: Router & WiFi Optimization**
✅ **Enabled Dual-Band WiFi**: Moved critical devices to the 5GHz band for reduced interference.
✅ **Created VLANs**:
   - **VLAN 10:** Business Operations (High Priority)
   - **VLAN 20:** Guest Network (Limited Bandwidth)
   - **VLAN 30:** IoT Devices (Low Priority)
✅ **Set Up Quality of Service (QoS):**
   - Prioritized VoIP and business applications over streaming or downloads.
✅ **Adjusted DHCP Settings:**
   - Reduced IP lease time to avoid unnecessary device congestion.
✅ **Configured Static IPs for Key Workstations**
   - Ensured stability for core business operations.

### **Step 3: Security Enhancements**
✅ **Updated Firewall Rules:**
   - Blocked non-essential ports and unnecessary traffic.
   - Allowed only whitelisted MAC addresses on the business VLAN.
✅ **Enabled WPA3 Security & MAC Address Filtering:**
   - Prevented unauthorized access.
✅ **Deployed VPN for Remote Workers:**
   - Improved security for offsite employees.

## **Results & Performance Improvements**
📈 **Before Optimization:**
- **Latency:** 150ms
- **Packet Loss:** 10%
- **WiFi Interference:** High (Single 2.4GHz Band)
- **Unauthorized Bandwidth Usage:** 40%

📉 **After Optimization:**
- **Latency:** Reduced to 40ms (60% improvement)
- **Packet Loss:** Decreased to <1%
- **WiFi Performance:** Optimized (5GHz for priority devices)
- **Unauthorized Bandwidth Usage:** Eliminated with VLAN segmentation
- **Network Stability:** No more frequent disconnections

## **Client Feedback**
🗣️ **"Our network performance has improved dramatically. Applications load 30% faster, and there are no more connectivity issues during meetings. This upgrade has saved us both time and money!"**

## **Conclusion**
By implementing **VLAN segmentation, QoS, firewall enhancements, and WiFi optimizations**, this small business significantly improved its network efficiency. **This case study demonstrates the impact of proper network configuration on business productivity.**

🚀 **Next Steps:**
- Continuous monitoring via a cloud-based network monitoring tool.
- Quarterly security audits to keep the firewall and network settings optimized.
- Implementing a backup internet connection for redundancy.
